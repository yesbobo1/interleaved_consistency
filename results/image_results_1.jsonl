Across the center, bold text reading \"Afterwork Routine\" on a yellow strip signifies the context of winding down after a workday.> captures the exact moment the woman places her hand on a smart lock—a gesture symbolizing her transition from a public role to a private one. This act triggers a sequence of post-work rituals: changing into loungewear, using smart appliances to tidy up, and restoring a personalized, controlled space. These everyday routines reflect urban women's desire to manage emotional boundaries and reclaim agency in domestic settings. The calming background music reinforces this process, aligning emotional rhythm with physical action. Together, these elements illustrate a form of self-repair embedded in middle-class domestic life—where the home becomes not just a shelter, but a site for psychological regulation and identity reconstruction.",
